#Convert the app sizes to a number

#Convert the number of installs to a number

#Transform “Varies with device” into a missing value

#Convert Current Ver and Android Ver into a dotted number (e.g. 4.0.3 or 4.2)
#Remove the duplicates
#For each category, compute the number of apps
#For each category, compute the average rating
#Create two dataframes: one for the genres and one bridging apps and genres. So that, for instance, the app Pixel Draw - Number Art Coloring Book appears twice in the bridging table, once for Art & Design, once for Creativity
#For each genre, create a new column of the original dataframe. The new columns must have boolean values (True if the app has a given genre)
#For each genre, compute the average rating. What is the genre with highest average?
#For each app, compute the approximate income, obtain as a product of number of installs and price.
#For each app, compute its minimum and maximum Sentiment_polarity
